".    "  <tr class=\"h\"><td class=\"b h\"><a name='gpg'>General Posting Guidelines:
".    "  <tr><td class=\"b n1\" style='padding:10px!important;'>Posting on a message forum is generally relaxed.  There are, however, a few things to keep in mind when posting.
".    "  <ul style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">
".    "  <li>One word posts.  These types of posts generally do not add to the conversation topic and should be avoided at all cost.  Come on, at least form a complete sentence!
".    "  <li>Trolling/flaming/drama.  This behavior is totally unacceptable and will be dealt with accordingly, namely with a warning.  Direct (or even indirect) personal attacks on <b><u><i>any</i></u></b> member of this community for any reason whatsoever will result in immediate action.  Do NOT test us on this.
".    "  <li>Reviving, or \"bumping\" old threads.  If the last post in a thread was a month ago or more, we ask that you do not add another post unless you have something very relevant and interesting to add to the topic.
".    "  <li>Spamming.  Spam is a pretty broad and grey area.  Spam can be generalized as multiple posts with no real meaning to the topic or what anyone else is talking about.
".    "  <li>Staff impersonation and 'back seat moderation.' Staff impersonation will <b>not</b> be tolerated. Doing so will may result in an instant ban. While you may feel you are helping by telling a fellow member that they need to stop doing something you know is wrong, you may do more harm than good. If you see an issue please report the issue to the staff immediately.
".    "  <li>Suggestive Material.  Remember that there are others here who enjoy the board experience. Their standards are not necessarily going to be like yours all the time, so please, do not post anything pornographic or otherwise potentially disturbing to other members.
".    "  </ul>
".    "  <br><b><u>Procedural</u></b>:
".    "  <br>Acmlmboard follows the \"Three Strike Rule\". This means if you have been warned twice by staff for whatever reason, your third notice will be a ban and a reason, coupled with a ban length.  Each time you are given a \"strike\", you will receive a PM from a staff member stating so.  This PM will also include a link to the post in question and a reason for the warning.  Your third strike will come with a ban.   Ban lengths are as follows:
".    "  <br>
".    "  <table cellpadding=0>
".    "  <tr><td>Offence</td><td>Duration</td></tr>
".    "  <tr><td>1st</td><td>1 Week</td></tr>
".    "  <tr><td>2nd</td><td>2 Weeks</td></tr>
".    "  <tr><td>3rd</td><td>1 Month</td></tr>
".    "  <tr><td>4th</td><td>2 Months</td></tr>
".    "  <tr><td>5th</td><td>Indefinite</td></tr>
".    "  </table>
".    "  <br>Please note that these ban lengths are \"soft\" and may be changed and/or deviated from by staff at their discretion. Decisions made regarding length will not be negotiable. If you have been banned but not warned, let a member of staff know.
".    "  <br>
".    "  <br><b><u>Behavioral</u></b>:
".    "  <br>Following one rule doesn't mean your post is automatically acceptable. If it is distasteful, repugnant, or offensive, then don't post it.
".    "  <br>
".    "  <br>If your post is seen by staff to incite drama, put down others, have negative connotations/bad attitude, or otherwise find fault therein, they have absolute right in deciding what to do with it and with you.
".    "  <br>
".    "  <br>IRC is IRC, and the board is the board, and there's a distinct level of separation between the two. However, we acknowledge that they are closely related and will make decisions based on your actions from both mediums of this community. This means if you're prone to being rude on IRC, and then rude on the board, it will most likely be considered when determining disciplinary action.
".    "  <br>
".    "  <br><b><u>Codeside</u></b>:
".    "  <br>The use of CSS usage to change your username colour, impersonate being staff, or similar is forbidden. Any alteration to one's username (font, icon etc) fake custom titles, and other additional text in a non-post field are under discretion of the the staff. Likewise, use of CSS that changes the board layout, others' posts or anything outside of your own post is forbidden. Failure to do so can result in deletion of your post layout, or even disabling the feature on your account altogether.
".    "  <br>
".    "  <br><b><u>Disclaimer</u></b>:
".    "  <br>If you don't like this place, or cannot deal with decisions or conversations had here, you will be offered no compensation and you will not be given any explanations herewith. This is a free service; so you are not entitled to anything contained herein, nor are you entitled to anything from any other party.

All crazy kinds of things can happen there, but will you take the plunge? Connect to the server irc.nolimitzone.com and join the channel. Mibbit is a great client to start with if you don't know what you're doing.

".    "  <tr class=\"h\"><td class=\"b h\"><a name='reg'>Can I register more than one account?
".    "  <tr><td class=\"b n1\" style='padding:10px!important;'>No, you may not. Most uses for a secondary account tend to be to bypass bans. The the most common non-malicious use is to have a different name, and we have another feature will allow this cleanly.

".    "  <tr class=\"h\"><td class=\"b h\"><a name='layout'>How do I get a layout?
".    "  <tr><td class=\"b n1\" style='padding:10px!important;'>You must code one yourself. Sometimes there are others who might be willing to help you with your layout.

Please read them over and follow them. Loss of post layout privileges will be enacted for those who are repeat offenders. If in doubt ask a member of staff. Staff has discretion in deciding violations. This list is expected to be updated regularly, so please make sure to stay up to date.
".    "  <br>The following are not allowed:
".    "  <ul style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">
".    "  <li>Modification of anyone else's post layout <b>for any reason</b>.
".    "  <li>Modification of any tables, images, themes, etc outside of your personal layout.
".    "  <li>Adding a custom title to your profile via css. Custom titles are provided using a board system.
".    "  <li>Altering your Nick color in any way. Nick color is an indicator of staff, and it will be considered impersonation of staff.
".    "  <li>Altering the board layout. A good example of this would be CSS that has your post text or any part of that table appearing anywhere in your sidebar. 
".    "  </ul>


".    "  <tr class=\"h\"><td class=\"b h\"><a name='title'>How do I get a custom title?
".    "  <tr><td class=\"b n1\" style='padding:10px!important;'>Custom titles are titles you can use in addition to, or in place of the ranks provided by the board. There are three ways to get them:
".    "  <ul style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">
".    "  <li>After 100 posts, or if you have been around 2 months you will need 50.
".    /*"  <li>Receive the *badge name goes here* badge. This can be given by staff, by special event, or by meeting a pre-determined goal.
".    */"  <li>Being a member of staff.
".    "  </ul>
".    "  <br>The custom title is a reward for being an active member of the community. Use of the custom title to impersonate staff, or to flame members/staff may result in the loss of custom title.
